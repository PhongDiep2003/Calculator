# Calculator
Implement the calculator app to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator allows you to switch between dark and light modes. 

#Bug
If the length of the input exceeds the width of the screen,Â the input will only display a portion of it on the screen, and the portion that exceeds the width of the screen will be hidden, but the calculator will still use the entire input to perform the operation.
